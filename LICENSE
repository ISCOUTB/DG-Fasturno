GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) [a√±o] Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                         Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license
that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify
the software. In addition, it provides that all modified versions
of the software must also be free software.

The AGPL is a more stringent version of the GPL that ensures
that the source code of the modified versions is made available
to users when the software is used over a network.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(as defined above).

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.

2. Basic Permissions.

You are permitted to use the Program, and you may make and distribute
verbatim copies of the Program, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and license notices. You may also
distribute modified versions of the Program, provided that you do
the following:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must distribute the modified Program under the same license
    as the original.

    c) You must keep intact all notices stating that this License
    applies to the Program and any other notices in the Program.

3. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of this
License, provided that you include a prominent notice stating that
you have changed the files and the date of any change.

4. Affero Network Server.

If you interact with a user through a network using the Program,
you must provide them with access to the source code of the Program.
This is known as the "Affero" provision.

5. No Additional Restrictions.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.

6. Acceptance.

You accept this License if you copy, modify, or distribute the
Program.

7. Termination.

If you fail to comply with this License, your rights under it
automatically terminate. However, if you do so fail and then
comply with this License, your rights reinstated. The reinstatement
is not retroactive.

8. Other Licenses.

You may not impose any additional restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted under this License.

9. Warranty.

There is no warranty for the Program; it is provided "as is".
